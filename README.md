I was born in 1996 in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo, in the city of SÃ£o Joaquim da Barra, and started my interest in the Information Technology area when I was 10 years old.

In 2013 I graduated in Computer Technician, and in 2014 I started the Computer Science course at the University of Franca. In the same year, I did a 5-month internship at the Civil Police of the State of SÃ£o Paulo, at the FundaÃ§Ã£o do Desenvolvimento Administrativo, where I developed, without burden to the State, a Patrimonial Management and Control System.

In 2015 I entered the Institute of Bioscience, Letters, and Exact Sciences - Unesp, located in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, and at the end of the same year, I started my career as a developer at the Junior Computer Science Company (ECCjr), where I stayed a year as a developer, and shortly after, two years as a Project Director. After three years of much learning and experience, carrying out projects together with ECCjr and interning as an Infrastructure Analyst at the 3D Creation company, I leave UNESP and return to my hometown (SÃ£o Joaquim da Barra).

Currently, I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Universidade Paulista, I am Python Backend Developer on Omie and owner of LMF Solutions.
